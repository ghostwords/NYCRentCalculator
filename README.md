## Bugs

- Estimated rates button needs styling
- Back button should work (take you back to estimated rates screen, back to showing less information, ...)


## TODOs

- Builds are not (no longer?) idempotent
- Review [eslint-plugin-react rules](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#list-of-supported-rules)
- Review Babel features
- Review React changelog, refactor into components
